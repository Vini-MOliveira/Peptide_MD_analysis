# Peptide_MD_analysis: MD Trajectory Analysis of Peptides

## Overview
This repository contains tools and scripts for analyzing molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of peptide simulations. It includes functionalities for computing RMSD, SASA, radius of gyration, and interaction counts, as well as visualizing these properties. Those MD descriptors can also be exported as .csv files for being used as ML features. 

## Introduction
Understanding the behavior of peptides in different environments is crucial for insights into their functional mechanisms. This repository provides tools to analyze MD trajectories, compute important structural properties, and visualize the results. 

## Some examples of Analysis and Interaction Results:

- RMSD per chain for different systems and replicas:
